## Overview

Appsmith CDK is a utility that allows you to define your Appsmith app's structure and configuration in code, rather than using the drag-and-drop interface of the Appsmith UI. This approach enables developers to manage their app's codebase more efficiently, version control it, and easily share it with others.
The code generator leverages a set of predefined templates to generate the necessary Appsmith JSON configuration files, which can be imported directly into the Appsmith UI. By describing your app's pages, widgets, actions, and interactions in code, you can create and modify complex applications programmatically.

## Features

- Generate Appsmith apps using code
- Define pages, widgets, actions, and interactions programmatically
- Easily manage and version control your app's codebase
- Share and collaborate on Appsmith apps as code
- Reduce development time and effort by automating repetitive tasks

## Getting Started

To get started with the Appsmith CDK, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/appsmith/appsmith-cdk.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the generator by modifying the templates and settings as per your app's requirements.
4. Run the generator: `npm run demo`
5. The generated Appsmith JSON configuration files will be available in the specified output directory.

## Usage

To use the Appsmith CDK, you need to define your app's structure and configuration in code. The generator uses predefined templates that you can modify or extend to match your specific requirements. The following steps outline the typical usage:

1. Define your app's pages, widgets, and actions using the provided templates or by creating your own.
2. Customize the template variables and settings to match your app's needs.
3. Run the generator script to produce the Appsmith JSON configuration files.
4. Import the generated files into Appsmith using the UI or API.
   Make sure to review the documentation and examples provided in the project's repository for detailed instructions on creating and configuring your app using the code generator.
